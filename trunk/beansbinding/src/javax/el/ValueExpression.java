/**
 * An <code>Expression</code> that can get or set a value.
 *
 * <p>In previous incarnations of this API, expressions could only be
 * read. <code>ValueExpression</code> objects can now be used both to
 * retrieve a value and to set a value. Expressions that can have a value
 * set on them are referred to as l-value expressions. Those that
 * cannot are referred to as r-value expressions. Not all r-value expressions
 * can be used as l-value expressions (e.g. <code>"${1+1}"</code> or 
 * <code>"${firstName} ${lastName}"</code>). See the EL Specification for
 * details. Expressions that cannot be used as l-values must always 
 * return <code>true</code> from <code>isReadOnly()</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The <code>{@link ExpressionFactory#createValueExpression}</code> method
 * can be used to parse an expression string and return a concrete instance
 * of <code>ValueExpression</code> that encapsulates the parsed expression.
 * The {@link FunctionMapper} is used at parse time, not evaluation time, 
 * so one is not needed to evaluate an expression using this class.  
 * However, the {@link ELContext} is needed at evaluation time.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getValue}, {@link #setValue}, {@link #isReadOnly} and
 * {@link #getType} methods will evaluate the expression each time they are
 * called. The {@link ELResolver} in the <code>ELContext</code> is used to 
 * resolve the top-level variables and to determine the behavior of the
 * <code>.</code> and <code>[]</code> operators. For any of the four methods,
 * the {@link ELResolver#getValue} method is used to resolve all properties 
 * up to but excluding the last one. This provides the <code>base</code> 
 * object. At the last resolution, the <code>ValueExpression</code> will 
 * call the corresponding {@link ELResolver#getValue}, 
 * {@link ELResolver#setValue}, {@link ELResolver#isReadOnly} or 
 * {@link ELResolver#getType} method, depending on which was called on 
 * the <code>ValueExpression</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>See the notes about comparison, serialization and immutability in 
 * the {@link Expression} javadocs.
