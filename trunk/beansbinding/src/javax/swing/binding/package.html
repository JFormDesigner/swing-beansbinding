This package contains classes that are useful for binding to Swing components.
<p>
When binding to Swing components, it's often useful to disable the target
component when the source property is unwriteable. This package contains
a subclass of {@code Binding} called {@code SwingBinding} which has a
{@code setDisableTargetOnUnwriteableSource} method to control this
behavior. The default is {@code true}.
<p>
Many Swing components have properties that do not fire property change
notification and therefore don't fit well with {@code Property} implementations
that rely on this notification. This package provides special {@code Property}
implementations for dealing with some of the important properties. Note that
where the examples show creating these properties with a reference to a
component, each of the properties may also be created with a reference to a
{@code Property} that provides the component. ie.
{@code JTextComponentTextProperty} has two constructors: one takes a
{@code JTextComponent} and the other takes a
{@code Property<? extends JTextComponent>}.
<p>
    In some cases, binding to certain Swing components is more complex than can
    be represented by a simple connection between two properties. For these cases,
    this package provides {@code Binding} subclasses to manage these connections.
</p>
The rest of this document details the custom binding support for various
Swing components.

<h3>JToggleButton (includes JCheckBox and JRadioButton subclasses)</h3>

The most useful thing to bind to on a {@code JToggleButton} is it's selected state.
As {@code JToggleButton's selected} property is not a bound property, this package
provides a special property for binding to, {@code JToggleButtonSelectedProperty}.
The following example illustrates creating a binding targetting a {@code JCheckBox}:

<pre>
  Property source = new BeanProperty(person, "male");
  Property target = new JToggleButtonSelectedProperty(maleCheckBox);
  SwingBinding binding = new SwingBinding(source, target);
</pre>

<h3>JSlider</h3>

The most useful thing to bind to on a {@code JSlider} is it's value.
As {@code JSlider's value} property is not a bound property, this package
provides a special property for binding to, {@code JSliderValueProperty}.
The following example illustrates creating a binding targetting a {@code JSlider}:

<pre>
  Property source = new BeanProperty(employee, "raisePercentage");
  Property target = new JSliderValueProperty(raiseSlider);
  SwingBinding binding = new SwingBinding(source, target);
</pre>

<h3>JTextComponent</h3>

The most useful thing to bind to on a {@code JTextComponent} is it's value.
As {@code JTextComponent's value} property is not a bound property, this package
provides a special property for binding to, {@code JTextComponentTextProperty}.
The following example illustrates creating a binding targetting a {@code JTextComponent}:

<pre>
  Property source = new BeanProperty(employee, "nickname");
  Property target = new JTextComponentTextProperty(nicknameTextField);
  SwingBinding binding = new SwingBinding(source, target);
</pre>

By default, {@code JTextComponentTextProperty} is updated when enter is pressed
or focus is lost from the component. This may be changed by calling the
{@code setChangeStrategy} method on the property. For example:

<pre>
  JTextComponentTextProperty target = new JTextComponentTextProperty(nicknameTextField);
  target.setChangeStrategy(ChangeStrategy.ON_TYPE);
</pre>
