  The classes in this package, and subpackages, provide a way to bind
  two properties of two objects together. This is done using the
  {@code Binding} class. A {@code Binding} is initially unrealized (no
  listeners have been installed).  To realize the binding, invoke the
  {@code bind} method.
  <p>
  The following example illustrates the bare minimum required
  to bind two properties of two objects together.
  <pre>
    Binding binding = new Binding(source, "sourcePath", target, "targetPath");
    binding.bind();
  </pre>
  Once bound, any changes to {@code source}'s {@code sourcePath}
  property are applied to {@code target}'s {@code targetPath}
  property. Similarly any changes to {@code target}'s {@code
  targetPath} property are applied to {@code source}'s {@code
  sourcePath} property.
  <p>
  Before a value is applied to either the target, or source, it passes
  through a {@code BindingConverter}. Before a value is set on the
  source from the target, it passes through a {@code
  BindingConverter}, then a {@code BindingValidator}. The {@code
  BindingValidator} may reject the change.
  <p>
  Some targets support additional configuration beyond that provided by
  {@code Binding}. This is accomodated by the {@code setValue} and
  {@code getValue} methods of {@code Binding}. See {@link
  javax.swing.binding.SwingBindingSupport} for examples.
  <h3>Binding Properties</h3>
  <p>
  Beans Binding supports the ability to extend the set of properties
  an object has. This is used when you want a bean to have properties
  that are only useful for the purposes of binding. This is
  accomodated by {@code PropertyDelegateProvider}. See {@link
  javax.beans.binding.ext.PropertyDelegateProvider} and {@link
  javax.beans.binding.ext.PropertyDelegateFactory} for
  details.
