  The classes in this package provide a way to create a binding between two
  properties. This is done by creating an instance of {@code Binding} with
  two {@code Property} objects.
  <p>
  A {@code Property} is an interface representing the concept of a property.
  Concrete implementations include {@code BeanProperty}, which uses reflection
  to access JavaBean properties, and {@code ELProperty}, which uses the EL
  expression language.
  <p>
  A {@code Binding} is initially unrealized, with no changes made, and no
  listeners installed. To realize a binding, invoke the {@code bind} method.
  Once bound, any changes to the value of either property is reflected by
  setting the value of the opposite property, according to the Binding's
  {@code AutoUpdateStrategy}.
  <p>
  The following example illustrates an minimal example of creating a binding
  between two JavaBean properties:
  <pre>
    Property source = new BeanProperty(sourceBean, "sourcePath");
    Property target = new BeanProperty(targetBean, "targetPath");
    Binding binding = new Binding(source, target);
    binding.bind();
  </pre>
  <p>
  Before a value is applied to either the target, or source, it passes through
  a {@code Converter}. Before a value is set on the source from the target,
  it passes first through the {@code Converter}, and then through a
  {@code Validator}, which may reject the change.
