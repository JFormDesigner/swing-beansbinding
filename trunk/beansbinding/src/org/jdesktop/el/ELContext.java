/**
 * Context information for expression evaluation.
 *
 * <p>To evaluate an {@link Expression}, an <code>ELContext</code> must be
 * provided.  The <code>ELContext</code> holds:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a reference to the base {@link ELResolver} that will be consulted
 *       to resolve model objects and their properties</li>
 *   <li>a reference to {@link FunctionMapper} that will be used
 *       to resolve EL Functions.
 *   <li>a reference to {@link VariableMapper} that will be used
 *       to resolve EL Variables.
 *   <li>a collection of all the relevant context objects for use by 
 *       <code>ELResolver</code>s</li>
 *   <li>state information during the evaluation of an expression, such as
 *       whether a property has been resolved yet</li>
 * </ul></p>
 *
 * <p>The collection of context objects is necessary because each 
 * <code>ELResolver</code> may need access to a different context object.
 * For example, JSP and Faces resolvers need access to a 
 * {@link javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext} and a
 * {@link javax.faces.context.FacesContext}, respectively.</p>
 *
 * <p>Creation of <code>ELContext</code> objects is controlled through 
 * the underlying technology.  For example, in JSP the
 * <code>JspContext.getELContext()</code> factory method is used.
 * Some technologies provide the ability to add an {@link ELContextListener}
 * so that applications and frameworks can ensure their own context objects
 * are attached to any newly created <code>ELContext</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because it stores state during expression evaluation, an 
 * <code>ELContext</code> object is not thread-safe.  Care should be taken
 * to never share an <code>ELContext</code> instance between two or more 
 * threads.</p>
 *
 * @see ELContextListener
 * @see ELContextEvent
 * @see ELResolver
 * @see FunctionMapper
 * @see VariableMapper
 * @see javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext
 * @since JSP 2.1
