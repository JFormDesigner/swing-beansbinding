/**
 * {@code Property} defines a uniform way to access the value of a property.
 * A typical {@code Property} implemention allows you to create an immutable
 * representation of a way to derive some property from a source object.
 * As such, all methods of this class take a source object as an argument.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Property} implementation may, however, be designed such that the
 * {@code Property} itself is a mutable thing that stores a property value.
 * In such a case, the {@code Property} implementation may ignore the source
 * object. {@code Property} implementations should clearly document their
 * behavior in this regard.
 * <p>
 * You can listen for changes in the state of a {@code Property} by
 * registering {@code PropertyStateListeners} on the {@code Property}.
 *
 * @param <S> the type of source object that this {@code Property} operates on
 * @param <V> the type of value that this {@code Property} represents
