Release notes for Beans Binding (http://beansbinding.dev.java.net)

0.6 Release (2007/06/20)
------------------------
Notes on this release are broken into the following sections:
  API Changes/Additions, Issues Resolved, Other

*** API Changes/Additions ***

  1) Binding.addBinding/removeBinding/getBindings have been renamed to the more
     descriptive Binding.addChildBinding/removeChildBinding/getChildBindings

  2) Binding.setSourcePath/getSourcePath have been renamed to the more
     appropriate Binding.setSourceExpression/getSourceExpression

  3) To enforce compile-time type safety, the Object varargs parameter has been
     removed from all constructors and methods in Binding and BindingContext.
     You must now call setValue directly. To allow for method chaining, setValue
     now returns the Binding. As an example, replace this Binding:

     Binding b = new Binding(source, "${property}", target, "property",
                             Parameter1, param1Value, Parameter2, param2Value);

     with this:

     Binding b = new Binding(source, "${property}", target, "property");
     b.setValue(Parameter1, param1Value).setValue(Parameter2, param2Value);

  4) Some Binding and BindingContext methods were updated to throw the more
     appropriate IllegalArgumentException (rather than IllegalStateException)
     for certain conditions.

  5) Binding now has a name property. The ability to name a binding assists in
     debugging. Its main goal, however, is to make it possible to fetch
     bindings by name. This will show its full utility with future changes
     making it easier to validate and then commit or revert bindings as a group.

     To support naming a Binding, the following API additions have been
     made to Binding:
       - Constructors that take a String name parameter
       - void setName(String name)
       - String getName()
       - addChildBinding methods that take a String name parameter
       - Binding getChildBinding(String name)
     In addition, the following additions have been made to BindingContext:
       - addBinding methods that take a String name parameter
       - Binding getBinding(String name)

  6) Added a Parameter to control the editability of a JTable when it is the
     target of a binding. A new EditableParameter has been added to
     SwingBindingSupport to control this. It can be used on a top-level
     binding to control the editability of the entire JTable, and/or on the
     binding's individual child bindings to control editability of individual
     columns. For example, to make all columns non-editable, except for
     the first:

     Binding b = new Binding(list, null, table, "elements");
     // whole table is non-editable
     b.setValue(SwingBindingSupport.EditableParameter, false);
     b.addBinding("${firstName}, null)
         .setValue(SwingBindingSupport.TableColumnParameter, 0)
         // this column IS editable
         .setValue(SwingBindingSupport.EditableParameter, false);
     b.addBinding("${lastName}, null)
         .setParameter(SwingBindingSupport.TableColumnParameter, 2);

*** Issues Resolved ***

  2: Need converters between various types and String
  5: JTable binding support doesn't support sorting and filtering

*** Other ***

  The JavaDoc in Binding and SwingBindingSupport has been updated to reflect the
  change to use EL for the source "property".
