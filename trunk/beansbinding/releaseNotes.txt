Release notes for Beans Binding (http://beansbinding.dev.java.net)

1.0 Release (2007/09/05)
--------------------------
This release represents a major re-architecture of the Beans Binding API, based
on feedback from members of the expert group and the community (Thank You!).
While the work on this project continues through the JCP process,
with feature additions and possible API changes to come, the current
state represents the core API that is expected, for the most part, to
persist. As such, we're calling it 1.0 and releasing!

Some of the major points of interest in this release:

  1) The concept of a property has been factored out into an abstract Property class,
     with two concrete implementations of interest: BeanProperty and ELProperty.

  2) Binding is now an abstract class representing a binding between two Property
     instances (typically associated with two objects).

  3) Binding with automatic syncing is implemented by a new concrete AutoBinding subclass.

  4) Bindings to complex Swing components (such as JTable, JList and JComboBox) are
     now handled by custom Binding subclasses.

  5) For those synthetic Swing properties that we expose via adapters, those with
     multiple possible behaviors are exposed as multiple synthetic properties.
     For example: "text", "text_ON_FOCUS_LOST" and "text_ON_ACTION_OR_FOCUS_LOST"
     for JTextField; "selectedElement" and "selectedElement_IGNORE_ADJUSTING" for
     JList and JTable.

  6) The classes have been repackaged under org.jdesktop packages.

Please note that the process of updating the project's unit test suite for the
re-architecture has not yet been completed. As such, the majority of unit tests
are not compileable or runnable.


0.6.1 Release (2007/06/22)
--------------------------
The purpose of this release is a set of name changes that make things
more intuitive and easier to use.

API changes:

  1) UpdateStrategy.READ_FROM_SOURCE has been renamed to the shorter
     UpdateStrategy.READ

  2) TextChangeStategy is now a top-level enum. In addition, the values
     CHANGE_ON_TYPE, CHANGE_ON_ACTION_OR_FOCUS_LOST and CHANGE_ON_FOCUS_LOST
     have been shortened to ON_TYPE, ON_ACTION_OR_FOCUS_LOST, ON_FOCUS_LOST.

  3) Binding.Parameter has been renamed to Binding.ParameterKey and
     Binding.setValue/getValue have been given the more appropriate names
     Binding.putParameter/getParameter.

  4) All Swing ParameterKeys are now in a top-level ParameterKeys class.
     They've been renamed as appropriate to reflect the fact that
     they are constants. A few have also been shortened.

  5) SwingBindingSupport has been removed. Documentation for Swing binding
     is now in the package-level documentation.

To see how some of these changes affect you, let's look at two examples:

Before:

Binding b = new Binding(list, null, table, "elements");
b.addChildBinding("${firstName}, null)
    .setValue(SwingBindingSupport.TableColumnParameter, 0)
    .setValue(SwingBindingSupport.TableColumnClassParameter, String.class);

After:

Binding b = new Binding(list, null, table, "elements");
b.addChildBinding("${firstName}, null)
    .putParameter(ParameterKeys.COLUMN, 0)
    .putParameter(ParameterKeys.COLUMN_CLASS, String.class);

Likewise, before:

Binding b = new Binding(object, "${property}", textField, "text");
b.setValue(SwingBindingSupport.TextChangeStrategyParameter,
           SwingBindingSupport.TextChangeStrategy.CHANGE_ON_TYPE);

After:

Binding b = new Binding(object, "${property}", textField, "text");
binding.putParameter(ParameterKeys.TEXT_CHANGE_STRATEGY,
                     TextChangeStrategy.ON_TYPE);


0.6 Release (2007/06/20)
--------------------------
Notes on this release are broken into the following sections:
  API Changes/Additions, Issues Resolved, Other

*** API Changes/Additions ***

  1) Binding.addBinding/removeBinding/getBindings have been renamed to the more
     descriptive Binding.addChildBinding/removeChildBinding/getChildBindings

  2) Binding.setSourcePath/getSourcePath have been renamed to the more
     appropriate Binding.setSourceExpression/getSourceExpression

  3) To enforce compile-time type safety, the Object varargs parameter has been
     removed from all constructors and methods in Binding and BindingContext.
     You must now call setValue directly. To allow for method chaining, setValue
     now returns the Binding. As an example, replace this Binding:

     Binding b = new Binding(source, "${property}", target, "property",
                             Parameter1, param1Value, Parameter2, param2Value);

     with this:

     Binding b = new Binding(source, "${property}", target, "property");
     b.setValue(Parameter1, param1Value).setValue(Parameter2, param2Value);

  4) Some Binding and BindingContext methods were updated to throw the more
     appropriate IllegalArgumentException (rather than IllegalStateException)
     for certain conditions.

  5) Binding now has a name property. The ability to name a binding assists in
     debugging. Its main goal, however, is to make it possible to fetch
     bindings by name. This will show its full utility with future changes
     making it easier to validate and then commit or revert bindings as a group.

     To support naming a Binding, the following API additions have been
     made to Binding:
       - Constructors that take a String name parameter
       - void setName(String name)
       - String getName()
       - addChildBinding methods that take a String name parameter
       - Binding getChildBinding(String name)
     In addition, the following additions have been made to BindingContext:
       - addBinding methods that take a String name parameter
       - Binding getBinding(String name)

  6) Added a Parameter to control the editability of a JTable when it is the
     target of a binding. A new EditableParameter has been added to
     SwingBindingSupport to control this. It can be used on a top-level
     binding to control the editability of the entire JTable, and/or on the
     binding's individual child bindings to control editability of individual
     columns. For example, to make all columns non-editable, except for
     the first:

     Binding b = new Binding(list, null, table, "elements");
     // whole table is non-editable
     b.setValue(SwingBindingSupport.EditableParameter, false);
     b.addChildBinding("${firstName}, null)
         .setValue(SwingBindingSupport.TableColumnParameter, 0)
         // this column IS editable
         .setValue(SwingBindingSupport.EditableParameter, true);
     b.addChildBinding("${lastName}, null)
         .setValue(SwingBindingSupport.TableColumnParameter, 1);

*** Issues Resolved ***

  2: Need converters between various types and String
  5: JTable binding support doesn't support sorting and filtering

*** Other ***

  The JavaDoc in Binding and SwingBindingSupport has been updated to reflect the
  change to use EL for the source "property".
