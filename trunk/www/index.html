    <h1>
      Beans Binding (JSR 295)
    </h1>

    <p>
      In essence, Beans Binding (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=295">JSR 295</a>)
      is about keeping two properties (typically of two objects) in sync. An additional
      emphasis is placed on the ability to bind to Swing components, and easy integration
      with IDEs such as NetBeans. This project provides the reference implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its current form, the Beans Binding work is targeted at version 5.0 of
      the JDK. The goal is to pull successful portions into a future version
      of the JDK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JSR 295 expert group launched this effort in the late summer of
      2006. Although the JSR has not reached the "Early Draft" JCP review
      stage, the ongoing work is being hosted here to give interested
      members of the community opportunity to provide feedback. The project
      continues to change and grow with input from the experts, and members
      of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intended audience of this project is members of the community
      interested in binding, who want to see where we're headed and to
      provide feedback. So that's exactly what we're looking for at this
      point; constructive feedback and bug reports are welcome.
    </p>

    <h3>A Note on EL</h3>

    <p>
    Beans Binding contains support for specifying properties using the Expression
    Language (EL) syntax from project Glassfish. As we required a handful of changes
    to EL in order to support the needs of Beans Binding, the EL source has been
    included, with those modifications, in this project. However, the eventual
    goal is to get these changes back into the official EL (and hopefully EL into
    Java SE). We do not intend to create a significant branch of EL with this project.
