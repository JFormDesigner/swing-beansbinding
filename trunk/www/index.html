    <h1>
      Beans Binding (JSR 295)
    </h1>

    <p>
      In essence, Beans Binding (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=295">JSR 295</a>)
      is about keeping the properties of two beans in sync. This project provides the reference
      implementation of Beans Binding, with an additional emphasis on the ability to bind to
      Swing components, and easy integration with IDEs such as NetBeans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its current form, the Beans Binding work is targeted at version 5.0 of
      the JDK. The goal is to pull successful portions into a future version
      of the JDK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JSR 295 expert group launched this effort in late summer
      2006. Although the JSR has not reached the "Early Draft" JCP review
      stage, this early prototype is being made public to give interested
      members of the community the opportunity to provide feedback. This
      version is just a snapshot of the ongoing design process, and it's
      likely to change substantially in the coming months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intended audience for this snapshot is members of the community
      interested in binding, who want to see where we're headed and to
      provide early feedback. So that's exactly what we're looking for at this
      point; constructive feedback and bug reports are welcome.
    </p>

    <h3>A Note on EL</h3>

    <p>
    Bindings between beans are specified using the Expression Language (EL) syntax
    from project Glassfish. As we required a handful of changes to EL in order to
    support the needs of Beans Binding, the EL source has been included, with those
    modifications, in this project. However, the eventual goal is to get these changes
    back into the official EL (and hopefully EL into Java SE). We do not intend
    to create a significant branch of EL with this project.
    </p>
